---

When the dust of the Piedmont meets the shimmer of strings, something magical happens. M.C. Taylor—heart and soul of Grammy nominated Hiss Golden Messenger—returns to his adopted North Carolina home to reimagine his music in a sweeping symphonic light with Conductor Christopher Dragon. With stirring arrangements by Jay Clifford and the Greensboro Symphony, this is more than a concert—it's the folk tradition reimagined—lush, lyrical, and larger than life!
