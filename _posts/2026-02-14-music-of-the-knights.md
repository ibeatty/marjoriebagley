Join us for a special Valentine's Day tribute to three of Britain's most iconic and "knighted" songwriters: Andrew Lloyd Webber, Paul McCartney and Elton John, who wrote some of the most romantic songs of our time, with legendary hits brought to life by a trio of Broadway soloists. Principal Guest Conductor Chelsea Tipton leads an unforgettable night of music and romance.
