Mandy Gonzalez possesses one of the most powerful and versatile contemporary voices of our time. Join us for the show-stopping pops finale as Mandy Gonzalez joins forces with the Greensboro Symphony and Conductor Christopher Dragon at Tanger Center. Known for her starring roles in Hamilton and Wicked, Gonzalez will bring her signature fire and soul to the stage, including the iconic anthem "Defying Gravity" that brought the house down at New York's iconic Gershwin Theatre!
