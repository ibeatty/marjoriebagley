Marjorie Bagley grew up in Wingate NC, and performed her first concerto with the North Carolina Symphony Orchestra at age XX. She received her BM summa cum laude in Violin Performance from the University of Michigan, completed her MM at the Manhattan School of Music as a student of Pinchas Zukerman, and has studied with Josef Gingold and Patinka Kopec.

After graduating, she played full-time as first violinist and founding member of the Arcata String Quartet. The ensemble received coaching from Isidore Cohen and members of the Tokyo and American String Quartets, and performed for nearly a decade around the US and Europe, including concerts in London's Wigmore Hall, Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie, and their NYC debut in Town Hall. They can be heard in recordings on the VOX label, alongside members of the Tokyo and American Quartets. The quartet performed across Europe over several summers, including a concert at the Rheingau Music Festival. They held artist-in-residence status at Utah State University from XXXX to XXXX.

Marjorie's teaching career began at age XX as an assistant teacher at the Meadowmount Music School, and continued through six summers as an assistant teacher at the Perlman Music Program. She has been on the faculty at summer chamber music festivals for high school students across the country, including the Kinhaven Music School, the Green Mountain Chamber Music Festival, and the International Music Academy Plzen in the Czech Republic. She taught and performed for eleven summers as an artist teacher at the Brevard Music Festival, frequently serving as concertmaster of the Brevard Music Center Orchestra under Music Director Keith Lockhart.

Marjorie taught violin and chamber music at Ohio University in Athens OH from XXXX to 2009, and then joined the faculty of the UNCG School of Music in the Fall of 2009. She performed as both Associate Concertmaster and Principal Second Violin in the ProMusica Chamber Orchestra in Columbus OH under the direction of Music Director David Danzmayr and Principal Guest Artist Vadim Gluzman. For two decades, she played chamber music with the Berkshire Bach Society alongside keyboardist Kenneth Cooper.

Currently, Marjorie serves as Concertmaster of the Greensboro Symphony under the direction of Christopher Dragon. In 2025 she fought an on-stage violin-mandolin duel with guest artist Chris Thile. In January 2026 she was the featured artist for Vaughn-Williams' classic concerto _Lark Ascending_. She also continues her love of chamber music by performing with colleagues in NC and around the country, exploring both classic and contemporary repertoire.

Professor Bagley teaches masterclasses at universities around the US. She remains fascinated by the unique qualities of each student she interacts with, combining an understanding of violin technique and learning strategies to help them move towards their potential. She particularly loves to perform and teach works by living composers and works that draw from a variety of musical styles.

Three decades of performances have taken her to five continents and led to many inspiring musical collaborations. She can be heard in recordings on the Equilibrium, Centaur, Albany, Summit, and VOX labels. Marjorie's time away from the violin is filled with family adventures alongside her husband, physics professor Ian Beatty, and their three children.
